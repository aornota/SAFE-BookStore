The last piano in the world
Is about to be played
In a room empty of all other furniture.
There are parts of the floor you cannot stand on.
These parts are called 'holes'.

The pianist has the last clean white suit,
The last hale shirt with tails.
Some people won't believe
Our sponsors found a piece of soap
For him to wash his hands.
But he has no shoes.
Alas, there are no longer any shoes... *)

...And the room fills with people,
Apart from those parts called 'holes' in the old language.
But some stand on the ground, in the 'holes',
With their heads looking over the floorboards,
Through ragged trousers, women's legs... *)
